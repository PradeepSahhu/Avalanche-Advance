    "name":"Army Of Undead",
    "description":"In the realm where life and death intertwine, the Army of Undead emerges as a chilling testament to the boundaries of mortality and the forces that defy them. Unlike any mortal host, these legions are comprised of souls once bound by flesh, now animated by dark magic or cursed existence. Each member of the Army of Undead bears the marks of decay and a twisted semblance of their former selves, their eyes gleaming with an eerie luminescence or empty sockets staring into the abyss.",
